<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Adem. I am a computer engineering student at Kütahya Dumlupınar University. I'm trying to improve my code knowledge and Unity skills by making clones of the original games.</h1>
<h3 align="center">Game Factory Jr. It is the clone of the "Count Masters: Stickman Games" game that I was asked to make to enter the training program. Camera tracking and Hold&Move mechanics have been added as requested on the example level. In addition, a character pool was created and if the character reduction/increase operators were contacted, the characters in this pool were processed. Thus, memory efficiency was achieved. Models such as box with needle, propeller and hammer on the stage were taken ready, but their animations were made by me. The number of characters in contact with these objects has been reduced.</h3>
